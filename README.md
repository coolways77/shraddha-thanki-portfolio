# research-portfolio

This GitHub repository highlights selected academic and research projects completed during my master's in High-Performance Computing & Quantum Computing at Deggendorf Institute of Technology.
These projects explore a mix of quantum simulation, HPC system design, disease modeling, and storage technologies â€“ documented through hands-on coursework and research collaborations.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents

### ðŸ”¹ [QLBM-Simulation](./QLBM-Simulation)
A quantum-classical simulation using Intel Quantum SDK to implement the Lattice Boltzmann Method for 1D advection-diffusion. This project explores the quantum representation of fluid flow and demonstrates encoding, collision, and propagation processes.

### ðŸ”¹ [Disease-Propagation-Simulation](./Disease-Propagation-Simulation)
A C++ simulation of disease spread across a population using the SIR model, written to understand herd immunity and vaccination thresholds. Parameters like transmissibility and duration are tuned to compare simulation results with theory.

### ðŸ”¹ [HPC System Design](./HPC-SystemDesign)
A collection of reports and papers written for system architecture coursework â€“ covering network topology, parallel file systems, benchmarking (FLOPS, IOPS), and environmental considerations like PUE and TCO.

### ðŸ”¹ [Storage Topics](./Storage-Topics)
Includes a presentation on the Network File System (NFS) and a short report on silicon design in storage infrastructure. These documents were submitted as part of storage-related coursework.

## ðŸŽ“ About Me

I'm a student researcher and aspiring software engineer with a background in industry and a growing interest in scientific computing. Currently exploring the intersection of quantum computing and HPC.
